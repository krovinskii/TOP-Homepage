# Small Service Business Homepage Project Submission

## Overview

This project is my final submission for the **Advanced HTML and CSS** course. Instead of creating a personal portfolio, I built a responsive homepage for a **small service business** using **11ty** (Eleventy) as the static site generator. The goal was to create a clean, functional, and fully responsive homepage that adapts across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, suitable for a business looking to showcase its services online.

  - **HTML & CSS:** Custom structure and styling to ensure a responsive and clean design.

## Project Files

- **HTML:** The structure of the homepage, created using Eleventy's templating language, includes sections for the header, services, about, and contact information.
- **CSS:** Custom styles were applied to achieve a clean and professional look that adapts across all screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:** The homepage is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- **11ty Usage:** I leveraged Eleventy's templating and layout system to generate static pages with minimal complexity, ensuring easy scalability if the business needs additional pages in the future.
- **Custom Fonts & Colors:** Fonts (Playfair Display & Roboto) and colors were chosen to reflect the business’s branding and provide a professional feel.
- **Icons & Links:** Social media and contact icons were integrated using SVGs from Material Design Icons to maintain a clean, modern look.

## Challenges

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the homepage layout works well across all devices was a key challenge. It involved setting up media queries and adjusting the layout using Flexbox and Grid to accommodate different screen sizes.
- **Implementing 11ty:** As this was my first time using Eleventy, configuring the templating system, creating layouts, and linking dynamic content required additional time and learning. However, it was very rewarding to see how efficiently Eleventy handles static sites.

## Deployment

The website has been deployed using **GitHub Pages**. The site is fully functional and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop use.

## Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to apply advanced HTML and CSS concepts while also learning how to use **11ty** (Eleventy) as a static site generator. Creating a responsive website for a small service business allowed me to focus on both the technical aspects of web development and the importance of user experience, especially across different devices. I’m proud of the final result and look forward to expanding my skills further.
